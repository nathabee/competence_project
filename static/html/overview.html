        <h2>Overview of the Kindergarten Evaluation Project</h2>
        <p>This project aims to create a platform similar to the one used by French professors for evaluating the developmental level of kindergarten students. The purpose of these evaluations is to identify students who may need additional support in early education.</p>
        <p>The platform is designed to assist teachers in assessing key competencies, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Language comprehension and vocabulary</li>
            <li>Basic mathematical understanding</li>
            <li>Logical thinking and problem-solving skills</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The system will allow teachers to enter students' results into a user-friendly interface, compare them with thresholds, and generate reports that highlight areas where additional support is needed.</p>
        <p>Key technologies used in this project:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for creating a responsive and interactive user interface.</li>
            <li><strong>Backend:</strong> Python with Django to handle server-side logic and data management.</li>
            <li><strong>Database:</strong> MySQL to store evaluation results, student data, and other information.</li>
            <li><strong>API Documentation:</strong> Swagger for API documentation, allowing seamless integration with other tools or systems.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For more information on the project and how it supports early education evaluations, you can explore the technical documentation and implementation details:</p>
