        <h2>Technical Overview</h2>
        <p>The Kindergarten Evaluation Project is a platform built to assist teachers in assessing the developmental progress of kindergarten students. It leverages modern web technologies to provide a smooth experience for data entry and result visualization.</p>

        <h3>Frontend Technologies</h3>
        <p>The frontend uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and possibly modern frameworks like React or Vue.js to offer an interactive and user-friendly interface. The data entry screens will allow teachers to input evaluation results, and a dedicated module will visualize the children’s performance using radar diagrams to highlight various competencies.</p>

        <h3>Backend Technologies</h3>
        <p>The backend is developed using Django, a powerful Python-based framework that provides robust support for building RESTful APIs. The backend handles user authentication, student data management, and processing of evaluation results. Teachers can access different API endpoints to input and retrieve data.</p>

        <p>The REST API enables easy integration with other educational tools, and it supports both data entry and result retrieval.</p>
        <p>For access to the detailed REST API specification, <a href="rest_api.html">click here</a>.</p> 
        <p>Swagger REST API documentation can be found <a href="/swagger/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p> 

        <h3>Database</h3>
        <p>MySQL is used as the primary database to store student information, evaluation results, and user data. The database is structured to efficiently handle large sets of student data and provides reliable storage for the evaluation results, which can be compared over time.</p>

        <h3>Radar Diagram Visualization</h3>
        <p>For visualizing the evaluation results, radar diagrams will be generated on the frontend using JavaScript libraries like Chart.js or D3.js. These diagrams will provide a clear, graphical representation of each student’s performance across various competencies (e.g., language comprehension, math skills, and problem-solving abilities).</p>

        <p>The radar diagrams allow teachers and parents to quickly identify areas where students may need additional support.</p>
