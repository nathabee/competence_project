        <h2>Technical Overview</h2>
        <p>The Kindergarten Evaluation Project is a platform built to assist teachers in assessing the developmental
            progress of kindergarten students. It leverages modern web technologies to provide a smooth experience for
            data entry and result visualization.</p>

        <h3>Frontend Technologies</h3>
        <p>The frontend uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and possibly modern frameworks like React or Vue.js to offer an
            interactive and user-friendly interface. The data entry screens will allow teachers to input evaluation
            results, and a dedicated module will visualize the children’s performance using radar diagrams to highlight
            various competencies.</p>
            
            <p>A demo version of the project can be found on <a href="https://nathabee.github.io/competence_project/" class="icon-link" target="_blank">
                <i class="fab fa-github"></i> GitHub page
            </a>
            This is a demonstration of the frontend, compiled and exported as a static file.
            It uses fake data and the export is deployed on github page. 
            This frontend interfaces a moking api and not Django : there is no interface to MySQL , and axios or jwt are moked.
            Keep in mind by using this link, that it is not using the database and may look incoherent.

            

        <h3>Backend Technologies</h3>
        <p>The backend is developed using Django, a powerful Python-based framework that provides robust support for
            building RESTful APIs. The backend handles user authentication, student data management, and processing of
            evaluation results. Teachers can access different API endpoints to input and retrieve data.</p>

        <p>The REST API enables easy integration with other educational tools, and it supports both data entry and
            result retrieval.</p>
            
        <ul>
            <li>Static REST API specification can be found <a href="swagger_json.html"> here</a>.</li>

            <p>This document defines the REST API for the <strong>Competence Project</strong>, which allows the
                management of evaluations for kindergarten students. The API provides access to add, retrieve, and
                manage data about students, evaluations, results, and more.</p>
            <!-- li>Swagger REST API documentation can be found <a href="/swagger/" target="_blank">here</a>.</li -->
        </ul>

        <h3>Database</h3>
        <p>MySQL is used as the primary database to store student information, evaluation results, and user data. The
            database is structured to efficiently handle large sets of student data and provides reliable storage for
            the evaluation results, which can be compared over time.</p>

        <h3>Radar Diagram Visualization</h3>
        <p>For visualizing the evaluation results, radar diagrams will be generated on the frontend using JavaScript
            libraries like Chart.js or D3.js. These diagrams will provide a clear, graphical representation of each
            student’s performance across various competencies (e.g., language comprehension, math skills, and
            problem-solving abilities).</p>

        <p>The radar diagrams allow teachers and parents to quickly identify areas where students may need additional
            support.</p>
