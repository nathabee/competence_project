# Django Competence Project

![Work In Progress](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-work%20in%20progress-yellow)

## Overview

This project is designed to manage and evaluate students' skills using various competency tests. It stores student information, their evaluation results, and provides a way to analyze their progress across different evaluation stages. The project uses Django as a backend framework, integrated with a REST API for external access by an Android application.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Work In Progress

**This project is currently under development and is not yet stable.**

We are actively working on adding features and improvements. Be aware that the current state includes:

- **Features**: Not all features are implemented yet.
- **Stability**: Some functionalities might be incomplete or contain bugs.
- **Documentation**: The documentation is in progress and may not cover every aspect yet.

## Project Structure

- `competence_project/`: Django project directory for competence evaluation.
- `competence/`: Django app directory containing models, views, serializers, and migrations related to competence evaluation.
- `db_scripts/`: SQL scripts for setting up and seeding the database.
- `static/`: Static files (CSS, JavaScript, images) used in templates.
- `templates/`: HTML templates used by Django views (if any).
- `tools/`: Utility scripts for managing the project.

## üõ†Ô∏è Current Status

- Initial project setup complete.
- Competence models implemented (students, evaluation stages, results).
- API development in progress.
- Ongoing testing and integration with Android app.

## üìà Future Plans

- Complete API development for mobile integration.
- Extensive testing of API endpoints.
- Add frontend or reporting tools (if required).
- Improved documentation and user guides.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To set up and run this project, follow these instructions:

### 0. Project Initialization

The project is initialized from GitHub. To get the code and set up the server, follow these steps:

```bash
chmod +x tools/setup_project_server.sh
./setup_project_server.sh
cd competence_project
chmod +x tools/*.sh
```

### 1. Server and Database Setup

Run the environment setup script for Apache, Python, and MySQL installation:

```bash
cd competence_project
tools/setup_environment.sh
```

- The database will be set up with:
  - **Database Name**: `competencedb`
  - **User**: `competence_user`



modify the  .venv file
```bash
cd competence_project
nano .venv
``` 

#   environment 
```bash
DJANGO_SECRET_KEY="your_production_secret_key"
DJANGO_SERVER_IP="your_production_server_ip"
DEBUG=False
DBNAME="your_production_dbname"
DBUSER="your_production_dbuser"
DBPASSWORD="your_production_dbpassword"
DBHOST="your_production_dbhost"
DBPORT="your_production_dbport"
ALLOWED_HOSTS=0.0.0.0,xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx,my_domain
```

### 2. Django Setup

Set up your Python virtual environment and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
cd competence_project
tools/setup_django.sh


### 3. Database Initialization

Run the database scripts located in the `db_scripts/` directory to initialize the required tables:

```bash
cd db_scripts
mysql -u competence_user -p competencedb < init_db.sql
```

### 4. Run the Server

Start the Django development server on a custom port (e.g., 8080):

```bash
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8080
```

Your server should now be running and accessible via the specified IP and port.
