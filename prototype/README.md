# PROTOTYPE APP

## retrieve from git 
cd your_competence_project_root_directory
git pull origin main 


## installation
cd prototype
npm install
npm run build
cp build/* InYourWebServerPrototypeAppDirectory




# starting app

 
development 
npm start 
start per default on port 3000, to specifiy another port
PORT=8084 npm start

production
npm run build
serve -s build -l 8084

### for standalone packaged experience
npm run build
serve -s build  
start per default on port 3000, to specifiy another port
serve -s build -l 8084
npm run electron-start


#### config for beginner (default)
 in the package-json there was 
  "scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "test": "react-scripts test",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject"
  },
  the file webpack.config.js is not used



#### config expert (change settings in package.json)

i have moddified with package.json
 "scripts": {
   "start": "webpack serve --mode development",
   "build": "webpack --mode production",
   "test": "react-scripts test",
   "eject": "react-scripts eject"
 },
  the file webpack.config.js is   used


 
## packaging your app with Electron for a smoother user experience

 for a more user-friendly solution (e.g., a single-click executable), Electron can wrap your React app into a desktop application.





# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
